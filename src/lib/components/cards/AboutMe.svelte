            <p>Hi, I'm Donovan, a software developer from Idaho, the land of the potatoes ðŸ¥”.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My primary tools of choice includes:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-3">
                <li>Python</li>

                Outside of software, I enjoy building new computersâ€”assembling components into powerful machines from scratch. When I'm not tinkering with hardware, I embrace the outdoors by rock climbing and skiing. As a football fan, I seize every chance to attend live games or watch them with friends. These passions keep my life vibrant and balanced beyond coding.

            <p>Even though I have my go-to tools, I always opt for the most suitable one for the task at hand, even if it's not among my usual choices. My objective is to find the optimal solution for every project.</p>
